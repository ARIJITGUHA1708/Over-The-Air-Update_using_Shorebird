# Over-The-Air-Update_using_Shorebird

This is a step-by-step guide to set up a flutter project using OTA update using Shorebird.

Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

Flutter SDK installed (preferably the latest stable version).

A Shorebird account.

Step 1: Install Shorebird

First, you need to install the Shorebird CLI tool. This is used to manage releases and patches for your Flutter app.

    brew install shorebird

Step 2: Configure Shorebird in Your Flutter Project

  1. Navigate to your project directory:

    cd /path/to/your/flutter/project

  2. Initialize Shorebird:

    shorebird init

  3. Add Shorebird dependencies:
     In your pubspec.yaml, add the shorebird_code_push dependency:

         dependencies:
         shorebird_code_push: ^2.0.4
     
     run:

         flutter pub get

   4. Configure Shorebird Engine:
      Shorebird requires its engine to be included in your app. Make sure your Flutter app is built using Shorebird.

Step 3: Build the App Using Shorebird
   
   Build the app for iOS:

      shorebird release --platforms=ios

   Build the app for android:

       shorebird release --platforms=android

Step 4: Create a Release

  Create a Release for iOS:

        shorebird release --platforms=ios

  Create a Release for android:

        shorebird release --platforms=android

Step 5: Implement Code Push in Your App

  1. Import the Shorebird package in your Dart code:

         import 'package:shorebird_code_push/shorebird_code_push.dart';

  2. Initialize Shorebird Code Push in your app:

         void main() async {
         await ShorebirdCodePush.initialize();
         runApp(MyApp());
         }

   3. Check for updates:

          ShorebirdCodePush.checkForUpdates();

Step 6: Create and Apply Patches
    If you need to update your app without releasing a new version, you can create patches. This allows you to send updates (e.g., bug fixes, asset changes) to users without a full app update.
    Create a Patch:
    After making the necessary changes, create a patch using the following command:

         shorebird patch --platforms=ios --release-version=1.0.0+4

   This will create an incremental update (patch) for your app.

   Apply the Patch:
   Once the patch is created, it will be available for users to download and apply the update over the air.

Step 7: Testing the Updates
   To test OTA updates:

  1. Install the app on your device from TestFlight (for iOS) or directly on your Android device.

  2. Make a code change or asset update.

  3. Create a patch using the command in Step 6.

  4. Your app should automatically check for the patch and apply it when itâ€™s available.

Test Using Shorebird Preview:

     shorebird preview --platforms=ios

Brief Steps for Building an iOS App in Flutter and Uploading to an Internal Website

Step 1: Go to flutter file and then run

    shorebird init

Step 2: run the command

    shorebird release --platforms=ios

Step 3: Go to xcode and archive the app and then upload the signed .ipa file to my internal website.
And then install the app through the generated QR

Step 4: Changed some UI and logic related things to my flutter app

Step 5: Run the command

    shorebird patch --platforms=ios --release-version=1.0.0+1

Step 6: After these steps I open the app and there is a button to check for updates, if updates available then shorebird install the updates in my app and require restart the app.

Step 7: After restarting, all the changes are applied in my uploaded app without installing the whole updated app.
